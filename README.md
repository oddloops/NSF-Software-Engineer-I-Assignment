## Assignment Description

Please write a software package that calculates the complex (yet entirely fictitious) Foo et al. parameterization. For our purposes, the parameterization can take the radius of a sphere and return its volume. However, imagine that this parameterization is complex enough to warrant its own software package.

You may implement the parameterization in a language of your choice (you will not be asked to justify your choice of language or be asked about performance considerations). Your design should be based on the following considerations:

This will be a community project, and you expect the continuous introduction of new science features over the course of many years by many contributors

You want to target a wide range of users, from those who want to use your software directly and interactively to those who want to incorporate your implementation of Foo physics in larger software packages
